Explaniation from Discord:

	YouTube API Wrapper → JS Clock Sync

		Goal: Query video info and sync to a clock.
		Mini-Challenge:

		Use the YouTube Data API to fetch video duration + current time (e.g., live).

		Sync it with a simple JS clock on a webpage.

		Display video thumbnail + live timer.

		Post screenshot + code.

	[AskJS] How would you sync YouTube playback perfectly with a JS clock? 
	(We turned this into a friendly coding challenge)


Solution Explanation:
	Youtubes internal clock is not time based. Instead it uses a tick based time system that is an interger 0-infinite.
	
	The project setup, demonstrates how a tick based system would solve this problem. Youtube renders at 30fps so that 
	is the projects default. If you adjust the FPS rate in the project, you'll notice the timer will get out of sync. For this to work you 
	need the FPS rate. The project is setup to skip ahead and  back using time or using ticks perfectly.
	
	This soultion also allows tracking the time no matter what the YT player playback speed is set. You just need to know how to adjust the FPS setting to keep in sync.


Out of scope:
	Ideally you would want something to monitor the FPS / buffering of the video to keep everything instep. This is all based on recieveing 30fps.
